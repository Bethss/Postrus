# Pots R' Us

We are going to create an API server for selling pottery.

Later we will build front end(s) for the server. To start, our main front end
will be Swagger.

## Requirements

### MVP phase:

- User can list all pots for sale.
- User can get details on a pot.
- User can buy a pot.
- User can cancel order.

### Requirements for later phases:

- User login.
- Credit card connection.
- Home page.
- Pot-maker interface.

## Design

- Fulfill requirements as API endpoints.
- Use flask-restx for API server.
- Keep database as simple text files to start. (Lean!)
